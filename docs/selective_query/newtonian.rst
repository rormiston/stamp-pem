Newtonian Noise
+++++++++++++++

The Newtonian Noise pipeline is very much similar to the "ordinary" stamp-pem
pipeline except that we want to plot coherence (as opposed to coherence SNR)
and use a log scale frequency axis so we need to be sure that we have
``plotsnr = False`` in the config file. Additionally, the channel list (here_)
is different from the ligo-channel-list.
